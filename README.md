## Master Word

Master Word is a word game, that allows to test your puzzle solving skills while teasing you by giving information about how close you are to the answer!

## Inspiration

Every member of our team loves solving puzzles. We came across a game called mastermind, for which we loved the concept, but the experience of playing that game was not good. We wanted to build a puzzle game, that would challenge anyone who plays it, providing just enough information as to tease the player with information such as how close they are to the real answer, yet leaving them scratching their heads on how to reach it.

## What it does?

Master Word is a word game, that allows you to test your puzzle skills while teasing you by giving you the information about how close you are to the answer. A word is picked at random by the computer from the English dictionary which the player is supposed to guess. The guess can only be a valid English word. The player gets 10 tries for every word, and after each guess, the player is told that how many alphabets in their guess overlap the ones in the given word, and how many of them are in the right position, thus acting as hints and enabling the player to solve the puzzle. After 10 tries, if the player is unable to guess the word, the world will be revealed to them, and they can try again with a different word.
